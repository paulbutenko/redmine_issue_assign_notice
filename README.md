When the assignee changed, the webhook set in the "Notice URL" will be executed and the following message will be posted.

The content of the message is as follows.

* Line #1: Information on change of assignee
* Line #2: Project name, tracker, ticket number, title, status
* Line #3: New ticket creation: description, ticket modification: note (up to 200 characters)

### Set Notice URL for each project?

If you check "Set Notice URL for each project?", you can set the Notice URL for each project.  
The Notice URL for each project is set in the custom field "Assign Notice URL" of the project. You should create a custom field and set it in each project.

### Mention to assignee? (Except when you assign yourself)

If you check "Mention to assignee? (Except when you assign yourself)", you can include mention for the user who was assigned to the message. However, the one set by the assignee themselves will not be notified.
